## Skills Narratives
### Fist Project - Software Engineering
To develop my first project required that I follow a tutorial, and understand enough of the components to modify for my use case. I decided to use Spring Boot in Java, giving me more exposure than previously, where I merely modified according to a tutorial. To understand the tutorials aims required that I use analytical skills and reading comprehension.

### Second Project - Data Structures
To develop my second project required that I study the most efficient data structures to pick the optimal one for a maze application. After reading I concluded that an adjacency list would best represent the graph, in turn representing the maze. I had some difficulty at first trying to represent the individual tiles in the maze, until I saw another project for an AI maze solver, that represented coordinates as two numbers rather than one. I realized that this would simplify the problem of converting a 2D list into a dictionary if I used a coordinates tuple. I then refactored the code to be object-oriented. 

### Third Project - Databases
For this last project I relied heavily on https://soshace.com/2019/09/05/implementing-role-based-access-control-in-a-node-js-application/.
