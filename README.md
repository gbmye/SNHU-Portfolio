## Skills Narratives
### Fist Project - Software Engineering
To develop my first project required that I follow a tutorial, and understand enough of the components to modify for my use case. I decided to use Spring Boot in Java, giving me more exposure than previously, where I merely modified according to a tutorial. To understand the tutorials aims required that I use analytical skills and reading comprehension.

### Second Project - Data Structures
To develop my second project required that I study the most efficient data structures to pic the optimal one for a maze application. After reading I concluded that an adjacency list would best represent the graph, in turn representing the maze. I had some difficulty at first trying to represent the individual tiles in the maze, until I saw another project for an AI maze solver, that represented coordinates as two numbers rather than one. I realized that this would simplify the problem of converting a 2D list into a dictionary if I used a coordinates tuple. I then refactored the code to be object-oriented. 

### Third Project - Databases
To develop my third project required that I first find the most common way to authenticate a RESTful service in Spring. I found the Spring Security framework, and built according to a tutorial. However, the code was out of date, I then tracked down the new methodologies used for every case where the code was incorrect. This required that I read documentation, as AI provided answers similar to the tutorial. This demonstrates my ability keep my composure and not give up.
